Digit Recognizer Kaggle Competition

## Methods
Classical problem. I worked on this program long time ago using various machine learning algorithms, namely LDA, QDA, KNN, Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Net. 

In this repo, I focused on the effect of deskewing the images as a preprocessing method and tuning parameters of SVM.
